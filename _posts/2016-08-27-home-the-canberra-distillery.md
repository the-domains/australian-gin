  As a small batch distillery we are unconstrained by the need to produce volume
  and can focus on quality. Many modern distillery's purchase ethanol from
  industrial facilities and re-distil it to add a flavour. The Canberra
  Distillery starts with just the raw ingredients: water, yeast and energy
  (grain, potato, fruit or sugar).
